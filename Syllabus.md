## Course Description
The course introduces the theoretical foundations of computing through the study of mathematical models of computing machines and computational problems. The course considers several models of computation with the intent of developing a theoretical and intuitive understanding of computability. Topics include finite state automata and regular languages, pushdown automata and context-free languages, Turing machines and recursively enumerable languages, decidable and undecidable problems. The course ends with an introduction to computational complexity.


## Course Objectives
By the end of the course, students will:
- Understand and implement core data structures.
- Analyze the time and space complexity of algorithms.
- Apply data structures to solve real-world problems.

## Prerequisites
- CS111, CS201

## Textbooks
- *An Introduction to Formal Languages and Automata, Peter Linz* (available in KU Bookstore.)
- *Introduction to the theory of computation, Michael Sipser*.
